# Chapter 9: AI for improving ozone forecasting

## Introduction

CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) is a widely used air quality modeling system that has benefited from advancements in AI. Here are a few successful stories highlighting the improvements AI has brought to CMAQ, along with the role of Geoweaver in accomplishing them:

## Enhanced Air Quality Predictions: 

AI techniques have been applied to CMAQ to improve the accuracy and precision of air quality predictions. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, into the modeling framework, CMAQ can learn from historical data and make more precise forecasts. Geoweaver has played a significant role in facilitating the integration of AI algorithms into the CMAQ workflow, enabling researchers to experiment with different AI models, train them using large datasets, and seamlessly incorporate them into the air quality modeling process.

## Emission Estimation and Source Apportionment: 

AI techniques have been employed to improve the estimation of emissions from various sources and to identify their contributions to air pollution. With the help of Geoweaver, researchers can develop sophisticated AI-based models that utilize geospatial data, satellite imagery, and ground-based measurements to accurately estimate emissions from industrial activities, transportation, and other sources. These models aid in identifying the major contributors to air pollution and inform targeted mitigation strategies.

## Data Assimilation and Model Calibration: 

Data assimilation techniques, combined with AI algorithms, have been utilized in CMAQ to assimilate observational data into the model and improve its performance. Geoweaver facilitates the integration of data assimilation methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter or particle filter, into the CMAQ workflow. These techniques help optimize model parameters, reduce uncertainties, and provide more reliable air quality predictions by assimilating real-time observations into the modeling process.

## Sensitivity Analysis and Scenario Evaluation: 

AI-based sensitivity analysis techniques have been applied to CMAQ to understand the impact of different emission scenarios, meteorological conditions, and model configurations on air quality. Geoweaver enables researchers to easily design and execute sensitivity analysis experiments, exploring the complex interactions between model inputs and outputs. This aids in identifying critical factors influencing air quality and optimizing emission control strategies.

## Summary
The integration of AI techniques into CMAQ has significantly improved air quality predictions, emission estimation, source apportionment, data assimilation, and scenario evaluation. Geoweaver plays a vital role in facilitating the development and implementation of AI models within the CMAQ workflow. It provides a user-friendly interface, standardized workflows, and seamless integration capabilities, allowing researchers to leverage the power of AI to enhance the performance and capabilities of the CMAQ system.
